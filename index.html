		<p> Hi there!</p>

		<p>I'm <strong>Daria</strong>, a graduate from the International Relations from Poland and currently living in The Netherlands. 
		<p>My favorite part of the day is the morning!
		<br>I love to work out knowing that the rest of the world is still asleep! </p>
		<p>I believe in the law of attraction so my goal is to push all the negative thoughts away. It might be a challange sometimes but the most important part is to keep trying.</p>
		
		<p>I've recently become more interested in the minimalism <br>and I can recommend you some nice readings below:
